## Guide for Apollo Sensor Unit

Apollo Sensor Unit (ASU) is designed to work with Industrial PC (IPC) to implement sensor fusion, vehicle control and network access in Apollo's autonomous driving platform.

The ASU system provides sensor interfaces to collect data from various sensors, including cameras, Lidars, Radars, and Ultrasonic Sensors. The system also utilizes pulse per second (PPS) and GPRMC signals from GNSS receiver to implement data collection synchronization for the camera and LiDAR sensors. 

The communication between the ASU and the IPC is through PCI Express Interface. ASU collects sensor data and passes to IPC via PCI Express Interface, and the IPC uses the ASU to send out Vehicle Control commands in the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol. 

In addition, Lidar connectivity via Ethernet, WWAN gateway via 4G LTE module, and WiFi access point via WiFi module will be enabled in the future releases.
