# How to Install Ubuntu Linux Operating System

## Helpful hints before you begin:

* It is recommended that you useÂ Ubuntu 14.04.3.
* You can type F2 during the system boot process to enter the BIOS settings. It is recommended that you disable Quick Boot and Quiet Boot in the BIOS to make it easier to catch any issues in the boot process.
* The IPC must have internet access to update and install software. Make sure that the Ethernet cable is connected to a network with Internet access. You might need to configure the network for the IPC if the network that it is connected to is not using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).
* For more information about Ubuntu, see Ubuntu for Desktop web site: https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop.
