# How to use a different vehicle

To add a different Vehicle, you must first follow the [Readme Installation steps](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/README.md) to assemble and launch Apollo successfully.

In order to support a new vehicle in DreamView, please follow the steps below:

1. Create a new folder for your vehicle under `modules/calibration/data`

2. There is already a sample file in the `modules/calibration/data` folder named `mkz_example`. Refer to this structure and include all necessary configuration files in the same file structure as “mkz_example”. Remember to update the configuration files with your own parameters if needed. 

3. Restart DreamView and you will be able to see your new vehicle (name is the same as your newly created folder) in the `Vehicle` dropdown menu.

4. Select the newly configured vehicle.
