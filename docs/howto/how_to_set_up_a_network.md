### How to Set up the Network

### Helpful hints before you begin:

* The IPC that is running the Apollo software must access the Internet to acquire the Real Time Kinematic (RTK) data for accurate localization. A mobile device also needs to connect to the IPC to run the Apollo software.
* It is recommended that you configure a fixed IP instead of using DHCP on the IPC to make it easier to connect to from a mobile terminal.
* Itis recommends that you set up your network according to the following diagram:

### Setting up the network:

1.   Install and configure a 4G LTE router with Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) capability and Gigabit Ethernet ports.


2.   Connect the IPC to the LTE router using an Ethernet cable.


3.   Configure the LTE router to access the Internet using the LTE cellular network.


4.   Configure the AP capability of the LTE router so that the iPad Pro or another mobile device can connect to the router, and, in turn, connect to the IPC.
